        <h1>The Wizard of OZ!</h1>
        <p><strong><span id="name1">Female #1</span></strong> lived in the midst of the great <strong><span id="state1">State #1</span></strong> <br>
        <strong><span id="feature1"> Geographic Feature #1</span></strong>, with Uncle <strong><span id="name2">Male #1</span></strong>, who was a<br>
        <strong><span id="job1">Occupation #1</span></strong>, and Aunt <strong><span id="name3">Female #2</span></strong>, who was the farmer's wife.<br>
        Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many<br>
        miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one roiom; and this<br>
        room contained a rusty looking <strong><span id="noun1">Noun #1</span></strong>, a <strong><span id="noun2">Noun #2</span></strong> for the<br>
        dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle <strong><span id="name2e2">Male #1</span></strong> and <br>
        Aunt <strong><span id="name3e2">Female #2</span></strong> had a big bed in one corner, and <strong><span id="name1e2">Female #1</span></strong> a<br>
        little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar-except a small<br>
        hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one<br>
        of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It<br>
        was reached by a trap door in the middle of the <strong><span id="noun3">Noun #3</span></strong>, from which a<br>
        ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</p>
