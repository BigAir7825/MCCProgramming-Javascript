# MCC Programming - JavaScript

## Overview

This repository serves as a reference for the programming course I completed during my Introduction to Internet Scripting class, which took place from November 2020 to February 2021.

## Class Structure

The Introduction to Internet Scripting class extended the concepts covered in my previous Web Page Creation course. It built upon the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and introduced JavaScript to enhance the functionality of web pages. The course structure consisted of lectures held twice a week and weekly project assignments. While PHP was also part of the curriculum, JavaScript served as the primary focus.

## MCC Structure

These courses were part of a specialized programming academy I joined through my high school. The academy emphasized self-directed learning. While MCC operates on a quarterly schedule, the programming academy divided courses into trimesters. In each trimester, I participated in two courses, each focusing on different topics.

## Note

This repository does not include a comprehensive list of all the projects I completed in this class but contains those I had saved on my local machine. Please be aware that these projects might not represent the most recent versions, as the use of version control systems (VCS) was required, and most projects were stored on a GitLab account to which I no longer have access.

The full list of courses I completed includes Computer Programming (in Python), Introduction to Information Technology, Web Page Creation (with CSS and HTML), Java Programming I, Java Programming II, Introduction to Internet Scripting (with JavaScript), Introduction to Database Design (with SQL), Mobile App Development (using Flutter and Dart), SQL Programming, C# Programming I, C# Programming II, and C++ Programming I. Among these courses, I was only able to retain Java and JavaScript projects.
